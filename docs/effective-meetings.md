# An opinionated take on running effective meetings

Running an effective meeting is an art form. A meeting is “effective” when the attendees can make forward progress on their end goal.

If you remember nothing else from this document, commit the following quote to memory:

<p style="text-align: center; font-size:1.5em;">"{Verb} with the end in sight"</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">~ Ex director who used to scold me a lot</p>

Meet with the end in sight. Plan next steps with the end in sight. Prioritize tasks with the end in sight. {Verb} with the end in sight.

We naturally create actionable next steps, and move as one collective unit when we laser focus on solving the end goal.

Conversely, when there is no end in sight, we brainstorm endlessly. We make not progress, but instead entropy.

This document shares strategies to run effective meetings. We provide a) a high level template to follow, and b) battle tested best practices (“plays”).

Remember - art form. Meetings are too context dependent to fully generalize. Master the plays, and employ them appropriately depending on the situation.

# Meeting Template

## Before scheduling

1. Define the agenda, and state how this relates to the end goal.

1. Mark required attendees. These are the team members who can influence decisions.

1. Callout required prerequisite information we need.

## At the Beginning

1. State the agenda

1. Confirm if required a) attendees, and b) prerequisite info are present.

1. Reschedule if they are not

## During the Meeting

1. Employ plays in subsequent section

1. **If you own the meeting, run the meeting.** You are empowered and responsible for making sure we make forward progress. If the meeting drifts, you are the one tasked with keeping the meeting on track.

## At the End

1. Call out the next steps we need to do to make forward progress.

## After the Meeting

1. Send meeting notes. Summarize the discussion points. Create a separate section for action items that includes owner, and due date.

# Playbook

## High Impact or GTFO

Don’t waste time on low impact areas.

Only call a meeting if there is QUANTITATIVE evidence that there is a large opportunity size. If you are a participant, do not take action items unless the opportunity size is clear.

We define opportunity size as the maximum achievable business impact.

## Fail Fast

Imagine spending months on a solution, only to hear at the last minute we cannot ship this to customers due to regulatory laws. Oof.

Failing fast prevents a long chain of ultimately fruitless meetings. Effective meetings present opportunities for attendees to fail fast by employing the following plays explored below:

1. ABCD (Always Be Collecting Data)
1. Empower Gatekeepers To Veto Early

## ABCD (Always Be Collecting Data)

Until you have conclusive evidence that a given approach is high impact, frame every action item as a data collection effort, and every meeting as a data review. This sets us up to fail fast at regular intervals.

After we identify that the opportunity size is large, do not call a meeting to ask how to productionize a pre-determined solution. Instead, ask attendees to review an A/B test proposal that estimates the impact (data collection) of a particular approach. In the next meeting, review the A/B test results. Assuming positive results, the subsequent meeting should spin off action items to estimate development effort to productionize (more data collection). After the feature is in production, measure whether it’s actually moving the needle on business metrics.

## Empower Gatekeepers To Veto Early

Effective meetings not only bring in gatekeepers early, but empower them with information so they can veto the project as early as possible.

We can prevent the above example, where we wasted months of engineering effort on a non-compliant solution, by involving a regulatory subject matter expert early, and empowering this expert to make a conclusive judgment.

Always keep the end in sight to identify the gatekeepers. Common gatekeepers include TK

## Brainstorm; A Time and A Place

## Details; A Time and A Place

TK

## Present Choices; Hotdog / No-Hotdog

Whenever possible, distill suggestions into binary questions.

Do not

## Talk is cheap

## Bullets

TK

## A Pic is Worth 1000 KB

TK

## Do what you said you would, or proudly declare you won’t do it

Be polite. Do the right thing. Do not let action items silently fade away.
