# An opinionated take on running effective meetings

Running an effective meeting is an art form. A meeting is “effective” when the attendees can make forward progress on their end goal.

<p style="text-align: center; font-size:1.5em;">"Keep the end in sight"</p>

Meet with the end in sight. Plan next steps with the end in sight. Prioritize tasks with the end in sight. {Verb} with the end in sight.

We naturally create actionable next steps, and move as one collective unit when we **laser focus on solving the end goal**.

Conversely, when there is no end in sight, we brainstorm endlessly. We make not progress, but instead entropy.

This document shares strategies to run effective meetings. We provide a) a high level template to follow, and b) battle tested best practices (“plays”).

Remember - art form. Meetings are too context dependent to fully generalize. Master the plays, and employ them appropriately depending on the situation.

# Meeting Template

## Before scheduling

1. Define the agenda, and state how this relates to the end goal.

1. Mark required attendees. These are the team members who can influence decisions.

1. Callout required prerequisite information we need.

## At the Beginning

1. State the agenda

1. Confirm required attendees are present

1. Confirm prerequisite info is present

1. Reschedule if they are not

## During the Meeting

1. **If you own the meeting, run the meeting.** You are empowered and responsible for making sure we make forward progress. If the meeting drifts, you are the one tasked with keeping the meeting on track.

1. Employ plays in subsequent section

## At the End

1. Call out the next steps we need to do to make forward progress.

## After the Meeting

1. Send meeting notes.
   1. Summarize the discussion points.
   1. Create a separate section for action items that includes owner, and due date.

# Playbook

## Show Impact or GTFO

Don’t waste time on low impact areas.

Only call a meeting if there is QUANTITATIVE evidence that suggests there is a large opportunity size. We define opportunity size as the maximum achievable business impact.

If the impact is unknown, do the pre-requisite homework.

## Empower Gatekeepers To Veto Early

Imagine spending months on a solution, only to hear at the last minute we cannot ship this to customers due to regulatory laws. Oof.

Effective meetings bring in gatekeepers early, and empower them to veto the project as early as possible.

Gatekeeps should be marked as required attendees.

## Brainstorm; A Time and A Place

Brainstorming involves open ended questions and is a critical process to solving problems. Brainstorming **_meetings_** need to clarify that the agenda is not to seek alignment, but rather to generate as many ideas as possible for later offline exploration.

The worst time to hold mini brainstorming sessions is during a meeting seeking alignment with a large number of stake holders.

## Present Opinionated Choices; Hotdog / No-Hotdog

Unless brainstorming, present opinionated choices. Instead of "what to eat for dinner tonight?", try "let's get italian cuisine tonight at the restaurant off of 5th and winston."

Having an opinionated stance provides a concrete example from which stakeholders can voice concrete opinions.

## ABCD (Always Be Collecting Data)

Until you have conclusive evidence that a given approach is high impact, frame every action item as a data collection effort, and every meeting as a data review. This sets us up to fail fast at regular intervals.

After we identify that the opportunity size is large, do not call a meeting to ask how to productionize a pre-determined solution. Instead, ask attendees to review an A/B test proposal that estimates the impact (data collection) of a particular approach. In the next meeting, review the A/B test results. Assuming positive results, the subsequent meeting should spin off action items to estimate development effort to productionize (more data collection). After the feature is in production, measure whether it’s actually moving the needle on business metrics.

## Keep It Stupidly Simple

Abstract the relevant aspects and simplify such that a VP who juggles hundreds of projects across the org can understand within seconds. Avoid wasting time on useless detailed discussions.

Keep slides sparse.

Employ simple diagrams. A pic is worth 1000 KB.

## Do what you said you would, or proudly declare you won’t do it

Do not let action items silently fade away. Be polite. Do the right thing.

# Closing Remarks

Be adaptable. Keep praticing and retrospecting. Stay focused on the end result.
