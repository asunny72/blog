# The Postpartum Butt Box

An amazing human being who we are blessed to be friends with who is a mother of two awesome kids gave us a unique gift at our baby shower: the post partum butt box. Like her, when we first opened the box, inside were items that we'd never encoutered before, but were all geared towards postpartum recoery. She has since passed the butt box (refilled with new items) to various expecting mothers, and now, it is our turn to share to box to you, the reader.

# Butt Box Inventory

1. Herbal Sitz Bath
1. Dermoplast - loacal pain reliever to spray directly on nether regions
1. Pads
1. Perineal Foam - soothing
1. Disposable Undies - super stretchy

# Directions

1. Put the pad on the super stretchy undies
1. Generously spray with Dermoplast (it may sting at first, but the analgesic will kick in)
1. Pump the perinal foam directly on the pad liner
1. Repeat above steps post bathroom break for the first 2 weeks postpartum

# Bonus - Nipple Butter

Hospitals may provide lanolin cream, but our friend found nipple butter to be more effective and would use before every feed, and before pumping. If there are little hard bits inside, the shea butter has hardened, so pop the container in some warm water, wait, then open and stir the butter should return to a smooth consistency.
