  - Mama's last day of work before leave starts
  - Mama too tired and uncomfy to pick friends up from airport

  - Mama could not get into a comfortable position during sleep

- 5/18

  - Morning: 2 mile walk. Slight discomfort throughout walk.
  - Pho for lunch.
  - Afternoon: Leisurely Costco run, followed by "relaxing at home".
  - 2pm: Contractions start. We were not aware they were contractions.
  - Evening: Contractions became regular and increased in duration and frequency. We called the advice nurse,and were told to monitor. We were still in disbelief, and thought discomfort was due to baby turning head down, or braxton hicks.
  - 10pm: called advice nurse since contractions 5-6 minutes apart and 45 seconds in duration. We were told to come to hospital
  - 10:56pm signed the Hostpial Conditions of Admission form and sent to triage
  - 11pm - 11:20pm: Nurses strap on baby monitor and instruct us to wait for 20 minutes. During this time delivery doctor came in and noted that cervix 3cm dilated and 80% effaced. Nurses also came in with various vacines/birth plan questions.
  - 11:30pm: Sign paperwork to be admitted into delivery room
  - 11:30pm: Nurses briefly left. Water broke.
  - 11:30pm - 11:45pm: Nurses attempt to connect IV to mama. No vein, so nurse need to call another nurse for assistance. Pain from mama intensifies, she felt nauseous.
  - 11:45pm - 12am: Hustle to the delivery room

- 5/19

  - 5/18 11:45pm- 12am: 4 nurses hustle and take mama into delivery room where they scramble to set up the equiptment
  - Doctor is urgently called into room
    -12am - 12:10am: Labor starts - Mama asked if she needed restroom first, mama politely refused

    - No time to administer any kind of pain medication.
    - Nurses barely moved Mama to bed, and papa beside her in the delivery room before Mama started first push. Could see a sliver of the baby's head
    - Mama hyperventilating after first push. Nurse firmly instructed mama to breathe
    - 2nd push: Papa asked to manually pin open Mama's leg as there was no time to properly set up the bed. Doctor's asked Mama if she wanted to see the head. Nurses instruct mama how to breath and push with the contractions. Doctor instructed nurses to shorten the bed as it was too long for her to "catch" the baby. Papa instructed to move mama higher up in the bed. Mama verbally stated she didn't want to do another push.
    - 3rd push. The longest push, but most powerful. All encouraged Mama. Eventually the head "popped" out, followed by baby's first (think Mario jump) and followed by white snake (umbillical cord)

  - 12:10am: Baby born.
    - Plopped baby on Mama, while two nurses were cleaning him.
    - Mama: "He's beautiful"
    - Papa asked to cut umbillical cord
  - 12:10am - 5am
    - Nurses give baby hep b vaccine and medicine in eyes, weight the baby, monitor vitals, sweet cheeks to test blood sugar levels
    - Mama pushes out placenta
    - Doctor stitches Mama (1st degree tear).
    - Nurses let mama rest, and accompany Mama to go urinate (else they would've needed cathoder)

# Postpartum Stay

I can no longer recall the specific details. Instead we will recall the noteworthy events. Note that these events intercut between each other (a chunk of event A occurs, then a chunk of event B, then back to the next chunk of event A, then event C, etc).

We stayed in the hopital until 5/22/24 afternoon.

## Gma to visit and provide support

Our immediate family members were either attending graduations in other states or travelling overseas. We informed all parties of the birth by 5/19 7am.

Fortunately, when mama's mother found out about the birth, she cancelled her upcoming trip to attend friend's daughter's graduation and took the week off of work to support us. She stayed with us during waking hours for an entire week, even after we left the hospital.

During this time, she exceled at holding the baby to help him sleep, making sure Mama and Papa were fed and hydrated, and helped us navigate a storm of context switches from various check-ups and nurse/doctor/lactation visits and made sure to ask critical questions that we may have neglected. She also took on the responsiblity of providing ALL other family members updates on the baby, so that Mama and Papa could focus on baby.
