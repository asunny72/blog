# Delivery and Postpartum Stay At the Hospital

Written: 20240604

# Labor and Delivery Timeline

- 5/17 4pm

  - Mama's last day of work before leave starts
  - Mama too tired and uncomfy to pick friends up from airport

- 5/17 9pm

  - Mama could not get into a comfortable position during sleep

- 5/18

  - Morning: 2 mile walk. Slight discomfort throughout walk.
  - Pho for lunch. Needed to stand up mid-meal to alleviate discomfort.
  - Afternoon: Leisurely Costco run, followed by "relaxing at home". Still felt discomfort throughout.
  - 2pm: Contractions start. We were not aware they were contractions. We thought they were simply a contiuation of the discomfort. Discomfort started to feel like a period cramp that got intense, then faded.
  - Evening: Contractions became regular and increased in duration and frequency. We called the advice nurse,and were told to monitor. We were still in disbelief, and thought discomfort was due to baby turning head down, or braxton hicks. Mama continued to "relax". Papa focused on building Ubuntu machine.
  - 10pm: called advice nurse since contractions 5-6 minutes apart and 45 seconds in duration. We were told to come to hospital
  - 10:56pm signed the Hostpial Conditions of Admission form and sent to triage
  - 11pm - 11:20pm: Nurses strap on baby monitor and instruct us to wait for 20 minutes. During this time delivery doctor came in and noted that cervix 3cm dilated and 80% effaced. Nurses also came in with various vacines/birth plan questions. Mama in too much pain to answer. Papa did in her stead.
  - 11:30pm: Sign paperwork to be admitted into delivery room
  - 11:30pm: Nurses briefly left. Water broke.
  - 11:30pm - 11:45pm: Nurses attempt to connect IV to mama. No vein, so nurse need to call another nurse for assistance. Pain from mama intensifies, she felt nauseous.
  - 11:45pm - 12am: Hustle to the delivery room

- 5/19

  - 5/18 11:45pm- 12am: 4 nurses hustle and take mama into delivery room where they scramble to set up the equiptment

    - Doctor is urgently called into room

  - 12am - 12:10am: Labor starts

    - Mama asked if she needed restroom first. Mama said yes, but then intense contraction started, and we all decided no time for restroom
    - Papa tried to stay out of the way of the nurses playing overcooked on Hard mode to prepare the room.
    - No time to administer any kind of pain medication.
    - Nurses barely moved Mama to bed, and papa beside her in the delivery room before Mama started first push. Could see a sliver of the baby's head
    - Mama hyperventilating after first push. Nurse firmly instructed mama to breathe
    - 2nd push: Papa asked to manually pin open Mama's leg as there was no time to properly set up the bed. Doctor's asked Mama if she wanted to see the head. Nurses instruct mama how to breath and push with the contractions. Doctor instructed nurses to shorten the bed as it was too long for her to "catch" the baby. Papa instructed to move mama higher up in the bed. Mama verbally stated she didn't want to do another push.
    - 3rd push. The longest push, but most powerful. All encouraged Mama. Eventually the head "popped" out, followed by baby's fist (think Mario jump) and followed by white snake (umbillical cord)

  - 12:10am: Baby born

    - Plopped baby on Mama, while two nurses were cleaning him.
    - Mama: "He's beautiful"
    - Papa asked to cut umbillical cord

  - 12:10am - 5am

    - Nurses give baby hep b vaccine and medicine in eyes, weight the baby, monitor vitals, sweet cheeks to test blood sugar levels
    - Mama pushes out placenta
    - Doctor stitches Mama (1st degree tear).
    - Nurses let mama rest, and accompany Mama to go urinate (else they would've needed cathoder)

# Postpartum Stay

I can no longer recall the specific details. I will do my best, but primarily I will recall the noteworthy events. Note that these events intercut between each other (a chunk of event A occurs, then a chunk of event B, then back to the next chunk of event A, then event C, etc).

## Fuzzy Timeline

- 5/19 8am - 5pm:

  - Lactation taught us how much, and how frequently to feed baby
  - Lactation taught us how to supplement with formula via SNS
  - Frequent heel pricks to test blood sugar levels
  - 3pm - 5pm: visitors
  - We learned that baby would need to go to NICU if blood sugar levels did not meet threshold X number of times
  - Learned to supplement baby's feedings with formula

- 5/20

  - 3am: Nurse taught us how to finger feed with SNS late night
  - Close to end of day: passed all remaining blood sugar tests

- 5/21

  - 1am: Nurse informed us that baby's body temperature lower than acceptable range
  - 1am - 4am: More temperature checks, baby consistently barely under threshold
  - 4am: sneakily turn up thermometer in the room
  - Morning:
    - baby temperature stable
    - lab technician took blood tests (stamps) for california genetic screening and caused intense crying for what felt like an enternity
    - pediatrician noticed really red belly button, nurse noted umbillical cord clamp was supposed to be removed yesterday, and that it could be causing irritation. Decided to have baby stay one more day in hospital to rule out infection
  - 230 pm: Lactation taught how to use nipple shield
  - Afternoon: final Jaundice blood test (favorable results)
  - 9:15 pm: Mama discharged from hospital, but baby still not

- 5/22

  - 11 am: lactation visit from Trish
  - 3:50pm baby discharged from hospital

## Blood Sugar Roller Coaster

Within minutes of birth, nurses administer "Sweet Cheeks", a glucose gel, to baby and shortly after measure blood suagar response. Baby's blood sugar level spiked, as expected, and we passed our first of many (perhaps 4-5?) blood glucose level tests.

Subsequently, nurses regularly (every 4 hours?) prick baby's heel for blood to monitor glucose levels. They want to ensure baby's brain receives enough glucose for healthy functions. Should baby's blood sugar levels read below acceptable thresholds, nurses adminster more sweet gel by syringe, and re-test an hour later. However, nurses can only adminster a limited number of sweet gels (4?) before they move baby to the NICU (neonatal intensive care unit).

Lack of information created lots of anxiety and emotional roller coasters for us.

We thought baby already passed initial glucose test, so were surprised when the 2nd test failed. Nurses mentioned they'll give him sweet cheeks and try again in an hour. Post sweet cheeks baby was doing great! So we thought all was good in the world once again.

Then suddenly we learned from pediatrician? (memory hazy) that perhaps baby isn't doing so great, and that a few more sweet cheeks and baby's gotta go to NICU.

Enter anxiety, shock, and heart broken-ness.

Few hours later, a nurse later followed up by asking us if we'd like to supplement with formula. We were disappointed because in our ignorant, sleep deprived state, we misunderstood formula for bottle, which meant death for breast feeding. But of course, baby's health comes first, so formula it is! (This is false by the way! Supplementing with formula is great! There are few different ways to supplement. Just don't supplement with a bottle until breast feeding is established!)

Though this should've been a dead give away that there is a correlation betweeen how much baby is eating, and blood sugar levels, we were unable to make the connection.

At this point, we learned how to breast feed, and supplement with pumped milk via a Supplementary Nutritoin System (SNS), which is basically a syringe connected to a tube that Mama essentially tapes near her nipple. Baby did not have a great latch, we did not have great technique, and were struggling to feed baby even just 5 mL. Formula did not make this easier. We frequently needed to call in a nurse to help with the feedings.

Enter another glucose test, and another fail.

Fortunately for us, fate set us up with a wonderful nurse named Christine, who I'm totally naming kid number 3 after, who was mindful we only had one sweet gel remainig, and taught us how to finger feed with sns. Turns out, you can connect the syringe's tube to your finger, and place your finger in baby's mouth to get strong latch and strong suck!

She sat with us and patiently hand stuffed baby 10 mL (at this point roughly double of what we've been attempting), and manipulated the next blood sugar test so that she could sneak in one more finger feeding before testing. She taught us what would happen at the NICU - nurses monitor and feed baby, and informed us so long as Mama and Papa were dilligent, and had an effective feeding method (finger + sns), we could do essentially what nurses would do in NICU.

Thanks to her help, baby barely passed the next blood sugar test.

We spent the remainder of our hospital stay finger feeding primarily, and no more sweet gels were needed!

This saga felt like a life time, but when I refer back to my notes, this whole saga occured within 36 hours. E.g., first glucose test was at birth on 5/19 1am or so, and the last test was on 5/20...er my notes say end of day 5/20, but I can't recall what end of day means (night time? post 5pm?) But still, it was a scary 36 hours!

To future new parents, information is power! Try to learn about the various tests hospitals administer and what "levers" parents can pull to increase baby's vitals readings, and hence favorable results.

## Temperature Drop

At around 1am 5/21, after we thought we were in the clear after the blood sugar saga, baby's temperature read just below acceptable threshold.

Nurse told us to triple swaddle, and 2 hours later, returned, retested, and observed another barely under threshold result. We were advised to skin-to-skin. We did. Another 2 hours later and yet another marginal fail. Nurse told us to try again, but perhaps with more blankets over us this time.

This time, we turned up the room temperature from 70 degrees F to 75 degrees F, and I believe we resorted to swaddling as papa was sleepy and worried about dropping baby. At the next test, baby passed.

When a new nurse shifted in, I forget exactly what I asked, but the conlusion was that the nurse told us she suspects the thermometers are NOT accurate.

This convinced Papa that room was likely colder than the reported 70 degrees F.

Phew, another mini crisis averted! But another scare and another round of anxiety!

We notice a pattern of scary events happening during "witching" hour when our emotional support folks are all sleeping.

## Jaundice Blood Draws

I cannot recall how frequent, or how many blood draws were taken.

Retrospectively, after witnessing two more blood draws for juandice post hospital stay, I susptect there were actually multiple tests, and that most nurses did not cause baby to cry beyond the initial heel prick.

However, on 5/21, around 7am or so, there was a terrible lab technician who needed to draw blood for a) CA genetic screening, and b) jaundice.

This technician needed to stamp baby's bloody foot onto various contact areas for different tests, and caused easily 15 minutes of wailing from baby.

Mama was so distraught she ran over to papa in tears. This was our first time hearing our son cry in pain.

By the time the CA test was done, there was no more blood coming from the pricked region of the heel, and the techinician could not draw a full vial's worth of blood. She did not want to do another prick, as she noticed both baby's heels had been pricked a lot already, and informed us she would come back in a few hours.

We mentally prepared ourselves for more crying. Fortunately, a new techinician drew blood, and the process took less than 3 minutes, and no crying from baby.

We were not happy with the technician that caused all that crying, and when we compared her to the new technician who caused zero crying, we hated the first technician even more.

Though, logically, to be fair, we are comparing apples to oranges. Perhaps the CA genetic screening test is the real evil.

## Lactation Nation

Similar to the blood sugar level testing, we did not have a good overview of the options, and were never presented a hollistic view of all the options and their respective pros/cons.

We were blasted with specific instructions, and did our best to follow.

Turns out, breast feeding is NOT intuitive for either Mama or a premie.

While still in the delivery room, a nurse instructed us to watch a video on breast feeding. We learned to sandwhich the breast such that the flattened breast would be parrallel to baby's lips and better fit in his mouth.

Few hours later, the first lactation consultant taught us how to use a breast pump. The same one (or perhaps a second) lactation consultant watched us breast feed, and gave us tips. We were struggling. Baby was not latching, Mama did not understand how to hold the baby to maintain good alignment. And there was no colostrum coming from the breast yet, or at least not much (i supsect we pumped it all out - we had an intial pumping of 20 ml, but subsequent pumps barely yielded 3 mL total). In my opinion, we did not have a good first feeding, this lactation consultatn, if i remember correctly, essentially told us to keep practicing.

Later on, a nurse inquired about our feeding. This nurse then saw we had stored pumped colostrum, and showed us how to use a syringe (looked like the same one from sweet cheeks) to feed baby! And how to use cotton swab stick as well. This helped us a lot! But not for long, because I believe we saw another lactation consultant shortly after, who taught us how to use SNS. This was another learning for us. Gma asked her about consulting resources outside of hospital. She could not answer due to hospital policy, but she has "friends who say so and so resources are so and so". With her help, we were able to administer colostrum! The next lactation consultant focused on teaching us which hold to use, and how to align baby correctly for the best latch, and how to hand express in rolling wave motion. She also taught us to use teacup, instead of sandwhich since baby is small. Once again, with nurse assistance, baby got lots of colostrum!

Yet, when we tried without lactation support, we failed miserably. Too much to learn while sleep deprived, and baby squirms around too much.

We were doing our best, but we knew we couldn't keep this up. Baby was barely getting the recommended volume, but every day the volume increases by 10 mL!! (we started with 5 mL).

Our first big breakthrough was learning how to finger feed.

Our second, was when we were given the nipple shield. Suddenly, though still difficult to properly align baby, baby had a very powerful latch and strong suck! And it was very easy to sneak the SNS tube into the nipple shield! What a relief! We can now breast feed at home without support from nurses!

Now the technical bits were okay (for now), but we were still confused on the scheduling and how to make decisions. I can't remember exatly when this occured, but there was an instance around 3 or 4am, where Mama and Papa needed to make a decision on what is more important, to push through a super slow (1.5 hour) feeding to get baby the minimum volume, or to let baby sleep and warm up due to low temperature. Papa made a firm choice that volume was more important (we forgot we could summon nurse), but that was a very stressful decision.

We need guidance on how to think about milk volume vs sleep schedule. And fortunately, our last lactation consultant, trish, had all the answers for us.

Part of the reason we were confused was because different nurses and lactation consultants, and pediatricians all had different answers and view points.

For example, we were told to feed 8-12 times a day. We were were also told to space feedings 2-3 hours apart starting from the time when feeding ENDS.

I asked a peditrician, and two nurses, who told us to count from when feeding ends. Another nurse said when feeding begins.

I double checked with pediatrician (not realizing the right person to ask would be lactation consultant). I gave the example, if a feeding takes, hypothetically, 12 hours, and we scheduled the next feeding 2 hours after the first feeding ended, baby would only get 2 feedings a day, NOT 8-12.

The last lactation consultant we saw was very helpful in this regard, and once again we need to thank fate.

We left the hospital confident on when to feed, and why, and we generally knew how to feed, but we were not confident and still worried how we would do this on our own.

Fortunately, Gma used her connections to find us a highly reviewed lactation consultant we could hire outside of the hospital!

Gma sneakily asked many folks these questions. It was against hospital policy for them to answer, but one in particual gave great subtext.

## Belly Button Fakeout

Baby's belly button, on 5/21 morning, was truly as red as a crayon!

Pediatrian was concerned it was an infection. Nurse was much more calm and suggested firmly it may have been irritation caused by neglect to remove the clamp yesterday.

Pediatrian left room to consult her peer. When returned, drew a circle around the belly button, and asked baby to stay another day so that staff can confirm that the redness does not spread, which would suggest infection.

Nurse removed the clamp and drew the circle on the belly.

We were not concerned, as we were biased by this nurse who clearly had seen this many times before.

We were grateful that we got another day at the hospital where we can summon nurses/lactation/food at the press of a button from our cozy hospital room.

## Swaddling

Our baby does not sleep without being swaddled tightly. Before leaving the hosptial, Papa felt he needed to learn how.

My thinking was that Mama will be so sleep deprived and tired just feeding and pumping, that Papa can be most effective by handling all auxilillary tasks, such as diaper changes, and putting to bed (swaddling).

Problem was, I could not swaddle for the life of me. Too loose of a swaddle and fabrics could break free and potentially suffocate baby. Too tight of a swaddle and it could contrain breathing and/or mess with healthy hip development.

And also, baby is squirming and seems to hate the process of being swaddled.

We asked every nurse to show us how to swaddle, but Papa just didn't quite have a knack for it.

Fortunately, Christine (same nurse who helped us with finger feeding) spent more time with Papa to really point out his issues and how to better swaddle and would closely watch his practice reps.

The core issue was that Papa was too scared of hurting baby, and did not have consistent technique and started combining bits and pieces from various nurses.

Gma brought a doll over, that helped Papa engrain the technique down. Papa practiced on the doll perhaps a bit too much (better safe than sorry).

By the time we left the hospital, Papa could swaddle and keep both arms trapped 2 out of 3 times.

## Gma to visit and provide support

Our immediate family members were either attending graduations in other states or travelling overseas. We informed all parties of the birth by 5/19 7am.

Fortunately, when mama's mother found out about the birth, she cancelled her upcoming trip to attend friend's daughter's graduation and took the week off of work to support us. She stayed with us during waking hours for an entire week, even after we left the hospital.

During this time, she exceled at holding the baby to help him sleep, making sure Mama and Papa were fed and hydrated, and helped us navigate a storm of context switches from various check-ups and nurse/doctor/lactation visits and made sure to ask critical questions that we may have neglected. She also took on the responsiblity of providing ALL other family members updates on the baby, so that Mama and Papa could focus on baby. Ah, and she used her vast network to find us a highly well reviewed Lactation consultant who we could work with post hospital stay.

## Driving Home From Hosptial

We asked Gma to drive us home, as we were aware some stat proved driving while sleep deprived can be just as dangerous as driving drunk.

The excitement of seeing Mama carrying baby outdoors was very exciting and emotional. Baby done with the tutorial levels and ready to start the adventure known as life!

We quickly secured baby into car seat, which we practiced while still in the hospital (due to policy we could not carry baby out in car seat).

Sadly, our premie baby didn't fit well. Only the shoulder straps were tight, the hip straps, and even the shoulder straps near the belly area, were flappy. And baby's head wasn't big enough to fit snuggly between the car seat's newborn insert head support section.

I was so fun to see baby show a new reaction: squinting and tighter shutting of eyes as light hit his face (after which I engaged the car seat's sun shield).

Baby was fussing, so I gave baby my pinkie finger to suck on. Dang he has a strong suck! My pinkie went numb by the end of the 30 minute car ride.

Once we arrived home, I was graced with the priveledge of carrying baby via car seat into our apartment. I could tell, my shoulders are gonna be so strong in the future.

Objectively we were not in hospital for long. Though to us it felt like a lifetime ago since we've last been home. It was just the way we left it - in the midst of cleaning out items to donate, and midway through setting up a new OS for the computer.

# Subjective View On The Overall Experience

## Mama

Hard to absorb new info. Felt it was coming from all directions. Underprepared for difficulty of breastfeeding. Tooke a while to realize that preemie had meaningful differences from full term.

Reall impressed with quality of people we were working with - all helpful, nice, and smart, and trusted that they had full picture even if I didn't. Exceeded my expectatations in terms of quality of care.

We did a good job maximizing our hospital stay, which was actually very comfortable.

Very emotional to see baby in first time, but still felt like myself and very grounded. Seeing the baby in pain was very hard, as was the idea of being separated, even though I knew NICU wouldn't be the end of the world

## Papa

Whirlwind of events. Hours felt like days due to influx of new experiences, emotions, and information. Information overload, and way too much context switching. Never felt I understood overview of what was happening. Just reacted and rolled with the punches. Super sleepy. First time in my life where I would need to make so many decisions with new information with unreliable short term memory with such little sleep. I will never complain about being on call for black friday again.

Felt emotional when seeing kid. Happy he is here, and alive. Realized how fragile life is. Did not get urge to hold him, but got urge to serve.

Thought about my grandmother and mother. Realized they went through the same experience and emotions and contextualized my past memories of them caretaking for me in a new light.
