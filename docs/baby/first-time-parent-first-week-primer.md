# Navigating the Postpartum Hospital Stay

Our postpartum hospital stay was an emotional roller coaster rich with exhaustion and information overload. We discuss tips we wish we could've provided our younger selves.

# The Tips

- The non-birthing parent (NBP) should bring a pocket size physical notebook.

  - Logging
    - NBP should log ALL events such as:
      - latest feeding details
      - tests administered
      - vitals readings
    - Pediatricians would directly ask us for this context to make informed judements
    - Nurses would occasionally ask us to update hosital records as they switched shifts
  - Note-taking

    - NBP should take notes from all hospital staff. Memory alone is not reliabe to store the information overload, frequent context switches, slightly varying details, especially when sleep deprived.

  - Write legibly. We recommend 0.5mm pen heads.

- Mama need only bring personal toiletries, shower shoes, and clothes to leave the hospital in. Kaiser will provide all else. I raise my fist to you YouTube influencers touting the aesthetic hospital bag. Don't bring in clutter!

- Keep adult sized nail clippers with toiletries to keep nails short.

- Allow one visting window on day 2+ in the evening.

  - No social vistors on day 1. The first day in the hospital consists of the most numerous visits from nurses and pediatricians. Visitors can create more chaos in an already fast-moving environment.

  - Wait until day 2 for visitors, and ideally towards evening as nurse activity seems to slow down.

  - Allow only ONE visiting window. This eliminates a constant stream of visitors, which can be disruptive to resting and interacting with hospital staff.

- Delegate mass updates to the support person (SP) - this should NOT be a parent. Delegate all questions and visit requests to the SP. The SP should be responsible for coordinating.

- Be open minded and prepared to learn EVERYTHING from the hospital staff.

  - Birthing parent (BP) and NBP should ask for lactation consultant frequently, and ask for consultants to visit again during feeding hours
    - NBP should take notes and pictures!
    - Key points to note down:
      - How to arrange the pillows around mama
      - What hold to use? If football hold, how far back should baby be? How far up? How tilted?
      - Lactation schedule

- Understand BEFORE-HAND what causes nipple confusion, which results in baby refusing breast milk in favor of the bottle. Specifically, research:

  - Feeding via syringe
  - Feeding via finger plus tube/syringe
  - Supplemental Nursing System (SNS)
  - If no time before hand, ask nurse to explain and ask nurse to confirm whether above methods will cause nipple confusion and if no, why not.

- Be proactive in feeding the baby! If the baby isn't feeding, do not hesitate to ping for assistance.

- Research how to supplement breast milk with formula via SNS

- NBP must ask nurses to teach swaddling. Practice under nurse supervision.

  - Our baby cannot sleep independently without a tight swaddle
  - This took us days to master due to fear of hurting the delicate -looking baby
  - Nurses will swaddle for you at the hospital, but then NBP will struggle when they take baby home.

- NBP should hog as many reps to swaddle and change diaper as possible. If there are mistakes, call nurse to help readjust

- Be prepared for a chaotic storm of nurses, lactation consultants, pediatricians, cafeteria staff, and cleaning staff

- Be prepared for slightly varying answers as different nurses/lactation consultants have slightly differing styles.

- Things we wish the hospital could improve on:
  - Provide general overview of who will visit, at roughly what frequencies, to do what

# Some Background

We are Kaiser Permanente members. Prior to delivery, we've taken Kaiser's breast feeding, new born care, and labor & delivery courses (and were still unprepared).

We did not have time to notify our emotional support members (baby's grandparents and aunts/uncles) until after delivery because a) we mistook contractions for expected discomfort from baby positioning its head down since the due date was not for another month, and b) labor took less than one hour.

The next morning after baby was born, grandma came to stay the days with us.
