# Navigating the Postpartum Hospital Stay

Our postpartum hospital stay was an emotional roller coaster through exhaustion and information overload. We discuss tips we wish we could've provided our younger selfves.

# The Tips

- The non-birthing parent (NBP) should bring a pocket size physical notebook and pen that encourages GOOD handwriting (we recommend a 0.5mm pen head).

  - NBP should log ALL events related to the baby such as:
    - latest feeding details
    - tests administered
    - vitals readings
  - We found that a) pediatricians would directly ask us for this context to make informed judements, and b) nurses would occasionally ask us and update the records as they switched shifts.

- NBP should also take notes from all hospital staff. Memory alone is not reliabe to store the information overload, frequent context switches, slightly varying details, especially when sleep deprived.

- Mama doesn't need to bring anything besides a) personal hygiene kit, and b) clothes to leave the hospital in. Kaiser will take care of everything else. I raise my fist to you YouTubers touting an aesthetic hospital bag. Don't bring in clutter!

- Bring adult sized nail clippers to keep nails short.

- No social vistors on day 1. Largest volume of nurses and parents need to limit context switch and rest! Wait till day 2, and ideally towards evening as nurse activity seems to slow down.

- Allow only ONE visiting window. This eliminates a constant stream of visitors, which can be disruptive to resting and interacting with hospital staff.

- Use the hospital's equivalent of "Do not disturb"

- Create one mass update chain, and delegate updating to the support person (SP) - this should NOT be a parent, but rather a close family member or friend who is present to help. Delegate all questions and visit request to the SP.

# Some Background

We are Kaiser Permanente members. Prior to delivery, we've taken Kaiser's breast feeding, new born care, and labor & delivery courses.

We did not have time to notify our emotional support members (baby's grandparents and aunts/uncles) until after delivery because a) we mistook contractions for expected discomfort from baby positioning its head down since the due date was not for another month, and b) labor took less than one hour.

The next morning after baby was born, grandma came to stay the days with us.

# Tips

Just the two of us for the first night

Take notes - storm of nurses and doctors and tests adds lots of confusion

every nurse/pediatrician/lactation consultant has a slightly different answer

goal for support parent: learn everything possible

What would be nice if hospital did: grease board for what to expect

visitors -> keep these to day 2 & beyond
mama doesn't need much stuff

create mass update chain in advance - delegate to one perosn

adult nail clippers

a note on nipple confusion and formula
