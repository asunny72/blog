# How Much Parental Leave to Take

All below statements are opinions heavily biased by my own context. YMMV

A good criteria for when to return to work is when will Mama get enough sleep to be happy and pseudo self sufficient during the day.

The biggest factor to mama's sleep duration, is how parents choose to feed baby.

## If Exclusive Breastfeeding...

If you plan on commiting to exclusive breastfeeding, make sure both parents concurrently take at least 8 weeks off, ideally 12.

Exclusive breastfeeding is VERY difficult, and the toughest variation of feeding a baby. Here are the challenges with breast feeding exclusively:

1. Mama cannot sleep more than one REM cycle at a time until 8-12 weeks when baby starts to sleep 5-6 hours at night. In all other forms of breastfeeding, mama and papa can take turns feeding, thus enabling each other to sleep for longer. To reiterate, this doesn't work with exclusive breastfeeding.

1. Mama needs help with baby's hands during feeding until baby learns to control hands at 12 weeks. Thus, support person who helps mama will experience some form of sleep interuption as well.

Notice a pattern? Essentially mama and papa will have pretty brutal sleep windows until 12 weeks.

Papa originally took one month off, and wanted to wait until mama returned to work after her 6 month leave to take the remaining time off. This model seems quite common at papa's company, and logically makes sense to extend the amount of time there is one full time parent around.

This model does NOT work for exclusive breastfeeding as both parents are needed to help each other get through the oh-so-very-long days. I would recommend waiting until mama can sleep more before one of the parents returns to work

## If doing hybrid approach with breast and bottle

Both parents should concurrently take at least 4 weeks off.

Webmd, healthline, La Leche League, What to expect, are but a few examples in a large pool of resources that argue babies will not have nipple confusion (state where they refuse nipple and prefer bottle) if parents wait around 4 weeks for breast feeding to be well established before introducing the bottle or a pacifier.

Thus, as explained in prior section, since breastfeeding exclusively is really tough for just mama alone, both parents should support each other for 4 weeks. After which, mama and papa can introduce the bottle, and start taking shifts feeding during night time.

For example, mama can be responsible for feeding baby from 8am - 2am, and papa can use a bottle to be responsible for feeds from 2am - 8am. In this scenario both paretns get 6 hours of consecutive sleep.

## If doing exclusive bottle

Both parents should take at least two weeks off concurrently to adjust to a new routine. To clarify, I opine that two weeks is the bare minumum. IMO, the longer the leave in any scenario, the better.
