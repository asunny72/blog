# Tips For Postpartum Hospital Stay

- Learn an overview of what to expect. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTzkECmoX8U) is a great starting point. This knowledge would have helped us feel less bombarded and less constantly randomized by what felt like an endless barrage of hospital staff.

- Various hospital staff will come in at what feels like all the time.

- Bring a notebook to take notes on: a) feeding details, b) when is next feed, and c) notes from lactation consultant and pediatrician

  - Write legibly!

- Mama need only bring personal toiletries, shower shoes, and clothes to leave the hospital in. Hospital will provide all else. I raise my fist to you YouTube influencers touting the aesthetic hospital bag. Don't bring in clutter!

- Only need to bring the outfit baby will leave hospital in!

- Keep adult sized nail clippers with toiletries to keep nails short.

- Be mindful that visitors can create more chaos in an already fast-moving environment - try to limit visitors on day one, and for us, we found day two, towards evening would have been a more ideal time for visitors as hospital staff activity slows down.

- Delegate mass updates to the support person (SP) - this should NOT be a parent. Delegate all questions and visit requests to the SP. The SP should be responsible for coordinating.

- Always ask for lactation consultation - even if things are going well. Ask for consultants to visit again during feeding hours

  - Take notes and pictures!
  - Key points to note down:
    - How to arrange the pillows around mama
    - What hold to use? If football hold, how far back should baby be? How far up? How tilted?
    - Lactation schedule

- Understand BEFORE-HAND what causes nipple confusion

- Be proactive in feeding the baby! If the baby isn't feeding, do not hesitate to ping for assistance.

- Ask nurses to teach swaddling. Practice under nurse supervision!

- Non birthing parent should hog as many reps to swaddle and change diaper as possible. If there are mistakes, nurse can help readjust. The idea is to split up responsibilities in the beginning such that between two parents, there is expertise in all areas, as opposed to both parents being mediocre in all areas.

- Be prepared for a chaotic storm of nurses, lactation consultants, pediatricians, cafeteria staff, and cleaning staff

- Be prepared for slightly varying answers as different nurses/lactation consultants have slightly differing styles.
