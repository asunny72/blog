# Our Breast Feeding Journey

After 42 days of strenuous effort, breastfeeding finally feels as advertised. Mama looks forwards to feeds during which she and baby experience a magical bonding. Mama and baby become one in mind body and spirit. Mama's breasts know when it's time to feed, and hearing baby's gentle hunger cries triggers milk let down. Mama can read baby cues like an open book. She knows when baby is frustrated by gas, and patiently helps baby process. She knows when baby is still hungry but sleepy, and that baby enjoys encouragement and speaking to. Nowadays, baby will even take breaks just to smile brightly at mama - baby's one true love. Mama relishes knowing that she gives baby both a nourishing meal, and emotional comfort. Mama feels it's quality time worth every ounce of effort.

There are additional benefits as well! It's nice not to wash bottles, or anticipate how many ounces of milk baby needs, or not needing to pump.

That being said, getting to this state was not easy. Getting to this point was the hardest thing mama has ever had to overcome.

Establishing breastfeeding was very difficult; a journey ripe with tears, blood, hopelessness, a desire to quit, and sometimes regret.

At its very worst, mama would describe breastfeeding as taking a razor blade to your nipple 4 times per feed, 8 feeds per day, for 3? weeks. The most painful part wasn't the acute pain during feedings, it was watching mama's emotional damage transform her in between feedings. She oft entered a pseudo-depressed state between feedings where her personality withered and she relied on consuming content from audio books or netflix to stay present. We watched mama break down before a feed in anticipation of the pain. We watched a confident, cheerful, playful person subject herself willing to torture and become a scared, paniced, fearful, mopey shell of her former self, all while forcing herself to put on a mask of happiness.

Throughout this journey, mama would often feel inadequate as a mother and a woman. "Why can't I feed my own baby who depends on me?"

We were so underslept, our emotional control and mental strategies to stay positive escaped us.

Days could not be any longer. Wasn't breastfeeding supposed to be a magical moment between mother and child? Why is it causing an active rift where Mama is less present than ever during feedings, and too emotionally depressed to play with baby more than once or twice after feeds?

This was an incredibly tough time in our lives, in that we were faced with emotional blow after blow, kept piling on frustration, and kept losing momentum. For example, online resources and lactation consultants would inform us that there shouldn't be any pain after an initial two week period.

We worked with a really good private lactation consultant who informed us that there will be pain - the nipple needs to leatherize. Then, there should be pain everytime at the start, but should get better quickly.

We gritted our teeth, and white knucked through two weeks, waiting for the leatherization.

Things did not get better.

He would be so grustrated we'd need to reattach all the time, or we wondered is he full?

But finally, we rounded a corner after we introduced a pacifier pre feeding. Mama's nipple "leatherized". We learned how to soothe baby before feeds for a calmer session, baby started opening larger and gave us better latches.

Our emotinal moods restored, and spirits lifted!

Mama is back to her old self! And now having so much fun with breastfeeding! Baby is now old enough to randomly stop feeding to smile at Mama. Mama is so intuned with baby's queues.

Crazy now that memories of the pain have been disappating into oblivian

they alleviate the preesure in her breasts,

All the things people told us along the way (oh he'll get the latch eventually, etc) did not seem achievable, but we got there, in our own time.

We detail below how we got to a point of good breast feeding

## Our theories on cause of pain

- abrasian against nipple shield
- fussiness would cause baby to pull off the nipple partially (transforming any latch into a shallow latch), and chomp on it as baby squirms around
- baby was used to only opening mouth the size of the nipple shield, as opposed to maximally large
- mama was used to enabling smaller opening, as nipple shield affords this
- baby was not patient, and we felt urgency to latch him asap, even when open wasn't sufficient
- it was hard to judge max opening

## Hearing the same messages, to no avail

## Sympathy was there, empathy seemed lacking

## Shared posts are always happy - don't represent overall mood
