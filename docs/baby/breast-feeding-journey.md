# Our Breast Feeding Journey

It took us, underprepared first time parents of a late stage pre-term baby, 42 days for us to be confident with breastfeeding.

Establishing breastfeeding was very difficult; a journey ripe with tears, blood, hopelessness, a desire to quit, and sometimes regret.

At its very worst, mama would describe breastfeeding as taking a razor blade to your nipple 4 times per feed, 8 feeds per day, for 3? weeks. The most painful part wasn't the acute pain during feedings, it was watching mama's emotional damage transform her in between feedings. She oft entered a pseudo-depressed state between feedings where her personality withered and she relied on consuming content from audio books or netflix to stay present. We watched mama break down before a feed in anticipation of the pain. We watched a confident, cheerful, playful person subject herself willing to torture and become a scared, paniced, fearful, mopey shell of her former self, all while forcing herself to put on a mask of happiness.

Throughout this journey, mama would often feel inadequate as a mother and a woman. "Why can't I feed my own baby who depends on me?"

We were so underslept, our emotional control and mental strategies to stay positive escaped us.

Days could not be any longer. Wasn't breastfeeding supposed to be a magical moment between mother and child? Why is it causing an active rift where Mama is less present than ever during feedings, and too emotionally depressed to play with baby more than once or twice after feeds?

This was an increadibly tough time in our lives, in that we were faced with emotional blow after blow, kept piling on frustration.

Online resources and lactation consultants would inform us that there shouldn't be any pain after an initial two week period.

We worked with a really good private lactation consultant who informed us that there will be pain - the nipple needs to leatherize. Then, there should be pain everytime at the start, but should get better quickly.

We gritted our teeth, and white knucked through two weeks, waiting for the leatherization.

Things did not get better.

But finally, we rounded a corner after we introduced a pacifier pre feeding. Mama's nipple "leatherized". We learned how to soothe baby before feeds for a calmer session, baby started opening larger and gave us better latches.

Our emotinal moods restored, and spirits lifted!
