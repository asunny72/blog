# Overview

We shall recap our journey starting with driving home from the hospital.

Using car seat for first time was scary, as our premie baby didn't fit well.

It was very exciting for me to carry baby (via car seat) from car into our apartment.

It felt like a lifetime and great to see our home again just the way we left it - in the midst of cleaning out items to donate, midway through setting up a new OS for the computer.

Fortunately, our nursery was 80% setup and prepared.

The first week home was scary for first time parents like us.

We would have no support from nurses, and there were so many skills we still didn't master.

Everything was moving so fast, and there were so many small things to do here and there. We were underslept, and operating on adrenaline.

Doctor's apointments were both reassuring, but also disruptive, and created more mental burden

No more hospital meal service brining us meals.

What helped us was getting into a rythym

First night w/out gma, start of week 2

-> we got into a rythm, patterns emerged, routine emerged. Doing the same thing every three hours again and again really helps you notice the smallest of deviations.

We learned hard lessons, namely, gotta claw and force self to sleep.

We both felt doom/gloom during the graveyard shift.

We were missing swaddles and baby mointors, and din't have amazon prime.

it was hard to remember the next feeding

paper work everywhere

every 1st time was nerve wracking. By the 10th time, we're okay.

Time moves slowly. One day equals 8 feedings. To us, every feeding felt like a day.

Game changer: we do not need to wake baby every 3 hours to feed. We can listen to baby's queues, but just make sure to don't exceed 4 hours with no feeding.

Baby naturally starting waking up every 3.5 hours. That extra 30 minutes was huge! Both physically (full REM cycle) and emotionally.

Now we like our routine, and dislike disruptions to it.

Support wise, need help with meals still

Need time to experiment with weening off of SNS, and adding in walks, and baths

Every moment was awesome. Baby is very cute. Feels great to be able to physically express your love.
