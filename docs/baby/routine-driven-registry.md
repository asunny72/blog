# Baby Registry And How The Items Fit In Our Routine

This document aims to knock out two birds in one stone: a) share an informed list of battle-tested newborn products (specifically 0 to 2 months) and ones to avoid and b) share our care taking routine.

These two topics naturally go together as we find the nursery/products themselves become a crucial member of the baby rearing team.

First we overview our routine, then we detail the rooms that aid us in our routine, and the newborn products in each room.

Note that we present the final, battle tested version. Our routine has gone through many iterations.

Disclaimer: Every baby is different. Every situation is different. Our routine was influenced by our choice to exclusively breastfeed, baby's preference for tight swaddles, and the size of our village.

## Routine

At a high level, our routine centered around four phases:

1. Feeding baby
1. Playing with baby
1. Soothing baby
1. Recharge

Baby would wake every 2-4 hours. Upon waking, we feed baby. After feeding, if baby shows signs of wakefulness, we play with baby. When baby shows signs of sleepiness, we put baby to bed. When baby is sleeping, the care taking team has team to recharge.

Our caretaking team consisted of three members: mama, papa, and gma. Since mama is irreplacable for breastfeeding, and since she needs to wake up every time baby wakes up, her "chores" center on all things feeding, pumping, and milk. Whenever possible, mama would rush to bed. Papa focused on all other support tasks such as diaper changes, swaddling, holding baby's arms during feedings, and help mama time the latch. Since papa can be replaced by another support person, papa would aggresively take on as many baby soothing shifts as possible to maximize mama's sleep time. Gma would be responsible for taking care of mama and papa. Gma would feed them, hydrate them, replenish laundry, keep the house clean, and hold the baby whenever possible to afford mama and papa more sleep.

Here is a depiction of our caretaking space:

### Feeding the baby

Baby wakes up in one of two places: the crib, or in a care taker's arms, who was resting in soothing station.

We always fed the baby in the nursery

Papa unswaddles baby in the crib, and moves baby to the diaper changing station to clean baby.

Meanwhile, makes any necessary feeding preparations at the feeding station. For example, when we still needed to supplement breastfeeding with pre-pumped milk, mama would retrieve the pre-pumped milk, and prepare the feeding tube and syringe we used to transfer milk.

Next mama moves to the nursing station and adjusts the nursing pillows and lays down towels and burp clothes to absorb milk spillages and spit up.

Once both mama and papa are ready, papa moves baby to the nursing station. Papa stands by to support mama, typically restraining baby's hands from interferring with breast feeding, and either helping mama with latch timing, or with the feeding tube or syringe.

Once baby settles, papa goes to the feeding station to log notes about this specific feeding. For example, papa updates a whiteboard with time of baby's most recent feeding, and the estimated time for baby's next feed.

Baby feeds from 30 - 45 minutes, including setup changes, and burp breaks. After the feed, mama holds baby upright for 15 minutes, and then call papa to take over.

Papa proceeds to change baby's diaper and if during the day time, papa puts clothes on baby, else, baby swaddles baby.

During this time, mama pumps, if needed.

### Playing with baby

The nursery was 80% ready - all of the major blocks and components were present, though we were lacking in accessories/smaller items that were needed to efficiently care for the baby, such as a shortage of linens.
