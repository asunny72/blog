<h1 id="the-invisible-support-person">The Invisible Support Person<a class="headerlink" href="#the-invisible-support-person" title="Permanent link">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>Of the baby caretaking team, Mama gets <strong>the most</strong> attention. Lots of loving friends and family will inquire about mama's health, and emotional mood, and provide oodles of love and support.</p>
<p>The other members of the caretaking team, on the other hand.....<strong>so little!!</strong></p>
<p>The person with least supprt is the invisble support person (or team) responsible for taking care of mama and papa. In our case, bubbe (gma).</p>
<p>Bubbe plays a thankless role where the difficulity level and exhaustion can be easily overlooked by others. Bubble worked herself so hard for so many weeks in a row, and slept so little that <strong>she drove herself to sickness and needed 2.5 days of bed rest to recover</strong> (she recovered excellently).</p>
<p>Bubbe left behind her posh home with the world's most luxiorious pool and entertainment space to stay with baby in a small 2b 2b apartment for 5 weeks. She skipped three parties and social events, one of which was a very special family occasion, to minimize the chances of getting baby sick. She took no weekends off, and dedicated 100% of her time to baby, mama, and papa.</p>
<p>What I immediately noticed is that Bubbe is an expert at sharing her love: while baby of course she finds irresistable and interacts with all the time, it doesn't distract her from sharing her love equally with mama and papa, and it doesn't distract her from her own perception of duty.</p>
<p>Befitting the nature of a long-time ex-CEO, Bubbe indepentenly identifies areas of needs, and focuses on solutions. She relentlessly obsesses on how she can be helpful, and is very proactive and respectful about boundaries/conflicts that may arise in both multi-generation caretaking, and co-living. I do not jest when I suggest bubbe should sell an online course titled "How Gma can co-live with her opinionated children and sweet grandchild".</p>
<p>Upon her first day of arrival, Bubbe brought dozens of bags of restaurant quality prepared food. Papa was enamored as he was, at the time, surviving on plain chicken breast, raw cabbage, and frozen mac and cheese. As usual Mama seemed ambivalent about food. After instructing papa on what to do with the food, she proceed to meet her grandkid for the first time. I do not remember what happend because I was stuffing my face. I'm sure it was magical.</p>
<p>Shortly after, to my surprise, bubbe came back and kicked me out of the kitchen. I expected her to hang out with the baby for longer. Instead she started studying the kitchen, and after some onboarding, prepared us what felt like a 6 course meal. Baby started fussing, and Bubbe abandoned her own meal to hold baby so that mama and papa could restfully eat, and then food coma. This act was <strong>HUGE</strong>. For the first time since baby was born, papa felt prioritized and nourished, and could suddenly see a future where days do NOT feel like physical torture. Mama has often said food is the secret to papa's heart. Perhaps it is true.</p>
<p>Beyond this first impression, the specific sequence of events esacpe my memory. But I will never forget Bubbe's actions and self sacrifice.</p>
<p>Reminder: Bubbe looks for solutions to problems. Relentlessly. Reminder: Bubbe is a grandmother who unconditionally loves her grandchild. Reminder: Bubbe is selfless. Each trait alone is obviously super helpful in its own right. The sum is greater than it's parts.</p>
<p>Late at night, Papa accidentally became an insomniac, and while he was trying to nap, he heard, for multiple nights, Bubbe singing baby to sleep, and to keep baby sleeping silently for 4 hours in a row. She realized that baby would stop fussing after baby hears a new song, but every new song would only work for about 10 minutes. Bubbe reveled in helping baby sleep better, and additionally, bubbe was worried that if baby started to fuss even a little, sleep deprived mama would wake up.</p>
<p>When baby finally arose, mama and papa fought Bubbe tooth and nail to get her to bed. Yet, every 2-3 hours bubbe would silently sneak out like a phantom and poke her head into the nursery to check in on us. Despite being super late at night (or early in the morning :shrug:), every time she would check mama and papa's water bottles, and fill them up with cold water. Then, at around 6am or so, Bubbe would appear out of nowhere to hold the baby to sleep so mama and papa can keep sleeping.</p>
<p>In the beginning, all Mama and papa did was sleep and nap. But not bubbe. During the day time, when bubbe wasn't with the baby, she was cleaning the house, fighting an endless storm of laundry, improving the ergonomics of the house, decluttering, and cooking mama and papa a brand new, restaurant quality meal. I kid you not every meal was different! She would venture out to gather groceries, and supplies such as larger baby clothes. She'd also frequently provide mama and papa snacks and tasty beverages.</p>
<p>The only break bubbe took was a mid day swim. Oh, that reminds me, for some reason though retired she still works for at least 4 hours every week day. Yes, her retirement party was a scam!</p>
<p>When baby started becoming more wakeful, Bubbe would tirelessly play with baby. She would read so many books to baby, show baby so many new sights, talk so patiently with baby with the most exaggerated faces, always finding new things to talk about. As a father, it was heartwarming to see someone be so engaging and gentle with his baby, again and again, and again. Suddenly I understand how bubbe came to memorize so may different books and songs.</p>
<p>But alas, bubbe is a vulnerable human like the rest of us. As much as she wanted to hog all of the sleep deprivation and labor from mama and papa, she isn't immune to exhaustion. And while mama and papa have greatly enjoyed the fruits of her self-lessness and intense work-ethic, we also now see, that as personality traits, these can be double edged swords.</p>
<p>Turns out, bubbe is actually quite a sensitive soul. She is often too hard on herself, almost feeling inadequte for not being helpful enough. She is sensitive to percieved mistakes she made, wanting to make up for her actions with even more labor. She puts the needs of mama before her own, often taking quick action to help mama feel better, even if it means the outcome isn't the one she prefers or imagines. She's like a shadow in that sense, always there, but always in the background, invisible.</p>
<p>Im not the best writer. I hope my prose properly expresses my gratitude. Bubbe has done so much for mama and papa in one of the hardest times in their life. Unconditionally.</p>
<p>We should not let her stay invisible. Bubbe deserves to be pampered the same way she pampered us. She deserves to be supported the same way she supported us. She doesn't need it, or our thanks, but she deserves it.</p>
<p>My primary call to action to bubbe's support people: take her on multiple spa trips, pay for multiple deep tissue sports massages, treat her to countless wonderful restaurants, and enable her to chase her dreams.</p>
<p>My secondary call to action. Is the support person's support person even more invisible? E.g., the co-chef who made us delicious chicken enchilladas, and helped Bubbe move into her new home so bubbe can focus on mama and papa.</p>
<p>Notable mentions that I did not work into the prose due to time constraints and lack of skill.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bubbe is super organized and great at improving organizational efficiency of any space. The kitchen and fridge are SUPER organized these days. And every room was decluttered.</li>
